To build the tables creation SQL using Java,
1. "Start your engines" by clicking on runCreateSQL
2. Enter the DB name - it's used to create the creation SQL file name and by some DBMSes
3. If wanted, enter a table name prefix (see the discussion of Virtual DBs in DiscussionDB.odt)
4. Select the DBMS appropriate template
5. Select the application config/ini file (see <DBMS>/CreateTables.ini for examples)
6. If appropriate, change the creation SQL file name
7. Click 'Build'
8. Check your new file

The "createJava" directory is the NetBeans java project.

Create the Config.jar:
  jar cvf0M Config.jar createConfig/Config.class
0 -> no compression; M -> no manifest; must use the dir structure to track package name.
In NetBeans, use Tools->Libraries to create new Config library with this jar file and add the library to the project libraries.

Create a Java archive (.jar) file using NetBeans as follows:
  1. Right-click on the Project name.
  2. Select Properties.
  3. Click Packaging.
  4. Check Build JAR after Compiling.
  5. Check Compress JAR File.
  6. Click OK to accept changes.
  7. Right-click on a Project name.
  8. Select Build or Clean and Build.

To run from the command line:
java -jar "/home/common/ProjectLogs/DB/createSQL/createJava/dist/createJava.jar"
or
java -classpath createJava/build/classes createSQL.create ${0%/*}

Deployment:
copy createJava/dist/lib & createJava.jar to Deploy dir
from Deploy dir:
tar -cf createTables.tar runCreateSQL createJava.jar lib
to list the tar:
tar -tvf createTables.tar

To deploy elsewhere, copy the tar and unzip:
tar -xf createTables.tar
